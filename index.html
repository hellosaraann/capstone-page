        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Whether directly addressed outside the clinic, or made to suffer through billboard sitings or casual workplace mentions, many who need or have obtained abortions still feel unable to come forward and address their critics. While movements like <em><a href='https://shoutyourabortion.com/' target='_blank'>‘Shout Your Abortion’</a></em> or <em><a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/style/busy-philipps-abortion-youknowme.html' target='_blank'>‘You Know Me’</a></em> have made wonderful strides in reducing the shame and stigma many are made to feel in society, the choice to come forward to tell your most personal story is not viable for many. These people are invisible and yet on display, silenced but discussed nonstop, shamed as being terrible while being demanded to carry and raise children.

        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
          I was inspired by four main things: a tremendous animated series on conception in the <cite><a href='https://www.nytimes.com/video/well/family/100000005653903/conception-trailer.html' target='_blank'>New York Times</a></cite>, an interactive impact report for <cite><a href='https://www.impactblacksheepagency.com/' target='_blank'>The Black Sheep Agency</a></cite> by <em>Heco</em>, the bravery and stigma-reduction from movements like <cite><a href='https://shoutyourabortion.com/' target='_blank'>Shout Your Abortion</a></cite>, and the personal experience of myself and friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          My highest hopes for the project reflected these inspiration sources. I wanted to encourage empathy through elegantly effective and moving storytelling. I hoped to keep those with differing views on the site for as long as possible through engaging interactivity, and in doing so hoped to educate. Even if just the smallest of details were to stick, I felt that would be an enormous success. Additionally I hoped that those with personal experience with termination would feel supported by the project, and that this support would add to other projects that have reduced the stigma and enforced shame felt by so many.

      <div class='col col-2'>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          The <a href='https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/90/9/12-107144/en/' target='_blank'><em>World Health Organization</em></a>, <a href='https://www.hrw.org/legacy/women/abortion.html' target='_blank'><em>Human Rights Watch</em></a>, and the <a href='https://news.un.org/en/tags/abortion' target='_blank'><em>United Nations</em></a> all recognize access to abortion as a human right. Prevention of access to abortion in cases of rape, incest or risk of death from pregnancy is <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jun/04/us-abortion-policy-extremist-hate-torture-un-commissioner-kate-gilmore' target='_blank'>considered torture</a> by these organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Statistically, one in four women in the United States will have an abortion by the time she is 45.<sup>5</sup> Additionally needing representation and care, 1% of all abortions in the United States are had by trans men, non-binary or agendered people.<sup>5</sup> Contraception and abortion have a long history, and abortion rates today are near equal in countries with the most restrictive access as with countries where there are almost no restrictions.<sup>24</sup> The truth is that people who can be pregnant have always needed and will always need the ability to choose to terminate the pregnancy.<sup>1</sup> Abortion does not go away with restrictions, bans, or laws, as evidenced historically and in countries with severe bans like <a href='https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/06/06/life-or-death-choices-women-living-under-honduras-abortion-ban' target='_blank'>Honduras</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          18% of all people in the United States want abortion to <a href='https://news.gallup.com/poll/244097/legality-abortion-2018-demographic-tables.aspx?g_source=link_newsv9&g_campaign=item_246257&g_medium=copy' target='_blank'>be illegal in all circumstances</a>. TRAP laws in conservative states are presenting frighteningly real challenges to Roe v. Wade, and even denying the Hyde Amendment by creating serious undue burden for those seeking access to abortion. The United States already has the highest maternal mortality rate of any developed nation (3 to 7 times higher)<sup>10</sup>. Maternal mortality is 8-11% higher in states with serious barriers to abortion<sup>22</sup>, on par with similar statistics<sup>24</sup> in developing nations where the procedure is banned or only allowed to save the mother's life.<sup>14</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          People who have abortions have long been shamed and made to <a href='https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/pubs/journals/Abortion-Stigma.pdf' target='_blank'>feel stigma</a> from the opposition, just as they have done to women who have children outside of marriage, and women who accuse men in power of rape. The different attitudes towards and control of male and female sexuality are on prime display in this debate. There is no regulation on <a href='https://www.newsweek.com/vasectomy-ban-bill-democratic-lawmaker-heartbeat-abortion-law-1359369' target='_blank'>viagra or vasectomies</a>. There is hardly any mention of men in the decision to terminate a pregnancy, though naturally they are very involved in the process as a whole. The burden and critique falls entirely on those physically having the abortion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since Roe v. Wade, abortions happen earlier<sup>30</sup> and <a href='https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/induced-abortion-united-states' target='_blank'>safer</a>. Two-thirds of abortions happen within the first 8 weeks of a pregnancy, and almost 90% happen within the first 12 weeks.<sup>5</sup> We are at a pivotal place in our history. Will we as a society continue to uphold and protect the human rights of women and those that can give birth to new life? Or will we join the ranks of 26 countries<sup>14</sup> with the most restrictive policies and philosophies on women and their role in society? The choice is ours to make, and ours to defend.

        <h2>Future</h2>
        <p>
          This project has been an absolute labor of love and demonstration of passion for the rights of women and all those affected by reproductive injustice. I have only scratched the surface of this immensely complicated and sensitive topic. Particularly, my research in regards to race and abortion need to be greatly expanded, as the deeply-entrenched inequities in our system make the risks of growing lack of access terrifyingly <a href='https://theundefeated.com/features/reproductive-rights-abortion-healthcare/' target='_blank'>harsh for women of color</a> in particular. My research on gender and abortion needs to be more fully investigated, as though only 1% of abortions statistically are obtained by trans men, non-binary, or agendered people, the prejudices in our system make these cases <a href='https://www.huffpost.com/entry/women-arent-the-only-people-who-get-abortions_n_5cf55540e4b0e346ce8286d3?guccounter=1' target='_blank'>especially difficult</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would love to continue to polish my site, and then distribute cards to my community. People are asking when it will be completed so that they can hand out cards. I hope that it will have even a small positive affect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another main emerging theme, is that people I interviewed felt a sense of relief to talk and share. Many had not told their stories before and responded to an opportunity to tell their stories anonymously. I would love to add features in the future with animations of stories where people that want to tell their story are paired with a professional animator / artist.
        </p>
        <p>
          And at the very least, there is just a ton of data that could be added to the timeline.
